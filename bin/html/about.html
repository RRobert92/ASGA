<h1>Microtubule length distribution analysis tool</h1>
<h5>*This analysis tool is part of the MT analysis program, which is work in progress.</h5>
<h3><strong>Overview:</strong></h3>
<p>A collection of shiny applications written in the R language for the analysis of the microtubule (MT) length distribution. This includes an application for reading excel table provided form "Amira ZIB Software", sorting data based on MT classes (KMTs or Non-KMTs), calculating histogram distribution of MT lengths and calculating percentage of total MT number.</p>
<h3><strong>Contribute</strong></h3>
<p>This tool is part of the MT analysis project. It is based on and evolves from ideas, contributions and constructive criticism of its users. Help us with maintain, develop, finding bugs and building new functionality as well as a user-friendly UI. Visit our resource page or write us an e-mail if anything crosses your mind.</p>
